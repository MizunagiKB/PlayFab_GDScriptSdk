:description: PlayFabSDK for GDScript
:url-repo: https://github.com/MizunagiKB/PlayFab_GDScriptSdk

This program is an *unofficial* implementation for using https://www,playfab.com[Microsoft PlayFab] from the GDScript(https://godotengine.org/[Godot Engine]).

CAUTION: Currently, only Godot 3.5 or higher is supported. +
Godot 4 is not supported.

This program can be used as-is by incorporating it into a Godot project.

This program is automatically generated based on the https://github.com/PlayFab/API_Specs[API_Specs] published by PlayFab.

If you want to customize the generated content, you can use the following to generate it on your own.

* https://nodejs.org/en/[Node.js]
* https://github.com/PlayFab/SDKGenerator[SDKGenerator]
* https://github.com/MizunagiKB/PlayFab_GDScriptTemplate[PlayFab_GDScriptTemplate]


## Usage

1. Copy PlayFabSDK folder to GodotEngine project folder.
2. Added res://PlayFabSDK/PlayFab.gd to AutoLoad under the name PlayFab.
3. Added res://PlayFabSDK/PlayFabSettings.gd to AutoLoad under the name PlayFabSettings.
4. Create testTitleData.json to GodotEngine project folder.

[source,javascript]
----
{
    "TitleId": "*****",
    "developerSecretKey": "********",
    "userEmail": "****@****.***"
}
----

Or, it can be embedded directly in the program as follows.

[source,gdscript]
----
PlayFabSettings.TitleId = "00000"
PlayFabSettings.DeveloperSecretKey = "XXXXXXXX"
----


### API Call

The API is called by _PlayFab_ . _{{category}}_ . _{{API name}}_.

To call the RegisterPlayFabUser function, write as follows.

[source,gdscript]
----
PlayFab.Client.RegisterPlayFabUser(...)
----

The parameters required to call the API are specified in the _Dictionary_.

[source,gdscript]
----
var dict_request = {
    "TitleId": "00000",
    "DisplayName": "****",
    "Username": "****",
    "Password": "****",
    "RequireBothUsernameAndEmail": false
}

PlayFab.Client.RegisterPlayFabUser(dict_request)
----

### Result

Use funcref to get the results.

[source,gdscript]
----
# callback function
func _request_completed(
    h_request: int,
    response_code: int,
    headers,
    json_parse_result: JSONParseResult
    ):
    pass
    # Describe here what you want to do.

# on function call
PlayFab.Client.RegisterPlayFabUser(
    dict_request,
    funcref(self, "_request_completed")
)
----


### Useful functions

PlayFab.is_valid()::
Check to see if you can call PlayFab from GDScript.
PlayFab.reset()::
Resets the current state and returns it to its initial state.<br>(Any information or requests in communication will be discarded.)
PlayFab.get_status()::
Returns the current communication status. HTTPClient.get_status information can be obtained from the data.
PlayFab.status_ntoa()::
get_status the information into readable information.
PlayFab.request_queue_size()::
Returns the number of waiting requests.


### Operating Specifications

* API calls are made in the order in which they are registered and are not processed in parallel.
* Only one person can log in within a single program. This is because only one EntityToken or ClientSessionTicket is stored in PlayFabSettings.gd.
