> PlayFabSDK for GDScript

This is a PlayFabSDK for GDScript generated using the forked PlayFab/SDKGenerator.
To generate them individually, you need API_Specs and SDKGenerator, which are forked.

- https://github.com/MizunagiKB/SDKGenerator

> Each has a branch called gdscript.

```
node generate.js GDScriptSdk=../PlayFab_GDScriptSdk -apiSpecPath ../API_Specs
```
